	We have survived the pandemic… so far. It’s so nice to see you all again. But times are tough. Bear with us while we find our feet again. Some stuff about how the pandemic affected us and what our plans are going forward.

<h3>Retrospective</h3>
<p>As we emerge from the pandemic, Newspeak House is looking to the future and how it can survive and thrive for many more years to come. A part of this is seeking constructive anonymous criticism from the communities it serves. We will do our best to take heed from any criticisms, wishes and visions that are shared here.
</p>
<p>
We understand that it can feel hard to give direct feedback, but we really hope that you will, as we genuinely wish to learn, improve and adapt, especially as attitudes and affordances may have changed significantly over the pandemic. We hope to become aware of our blind spots, such that we will be more able to address them.
